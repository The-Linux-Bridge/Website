          <h1>We are the Linux Bridge </h1>
          <h5>A nonprofit organization focused primarily on helping people transition over from proprietary services such as the Windows operating system over to the more secure, efficient and private system known as Linux. </h5>
          <h5>We offer excellent customer support that will guide you step by step through any issues you may have.</h5>
          <h5>We are dedicated to spreading the free and open source software philosophy to our local community and people around the world.</h5>
          <h5>We will ensure that our clients use the proper security and privacy practices that will be necessary for the coming technology driven future.</h5>
          <br>
          <p> Our primary objective is to spread the open source philosophy and help build a world where the average person knows and understands the options they have when using technology. The Linux Bridge will share the benefits of open source technology and will make it easier to transition over to libre projects such as GNU/Linux. Linux has always been regarded as something that cannot be considered as a functioning general use computer system for the average person, but that hasn't been true for years! With recent developments in the responsiveness of desktop environments and user friendly setups, Linux should be considered the standard of what an operating system should be on a device that YOU own.</p>
